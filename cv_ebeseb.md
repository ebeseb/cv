# public CV - Sebastian Eberhardt
I am Sebastian, passionate CUDA coder, dad and rock climber. I have more than 11 years of experience in writing HPC simulation codes with both high academic standards, and in an industrial environment with real applications, high time pressure and limited budgets. I love the spirit of early stage startups, and have seen one grow from 25 people to 800. My skills, and expertise in leading and growing teams are a perfect fit for any company seeking to start or transition towards GPU computing of their software. I strongly 
believe in continuous learning and self development.
Above that I have a strong interest in IT Security, as can be seen in one of my side projects which was obtaining the PNPT certification (see below).

## Experience
### Lilium eAircraft GmbH
<div align="right"><b>03/2023 - present</b></div>

**Senior Software Engineer – Internal Tools**
- Development of internal Flight and Applied Sciences tools with Python dash, including API, GUI and server back-end.

<div align="right"><b>02/2017 - 02/2023</b></div>

**Team Lead - Aerodynamics Software Development**
- Worked on two HPC numerical codes for fluid dynamics (CFD), which are designed to run in parallel on many high end GPUs, using C++17/CUDA.
	1. High fidelity acoustics Large-eddy Simulation (LES) code for turbomachinery simulations.
	2. High performance LES code for simulating the entire Lilium Jet. It currently is one of the fastest LES codes while maintaining sufficient accuracy (see the publication listed below).
- Major contributions to: high level software architecture, inter-GPU communication with MPI, automatic mesh refinement algorithm, post processing routines, optimizations, verification & validation automation, code reviews.
- Code debugging and profiling for optimization using Nvidia developer tools.
- Administration of Lilium’s DGX high performance servers.
